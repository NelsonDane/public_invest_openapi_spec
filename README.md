# Public Invest OpenAPI Specification

## Update
With the release of the official Public API [python SDK](https://github.com/PublicDotCom/publicdotcom-py), this unofficial implementation is now deprecated. Please move to the official SDK for continued support and updates. Thank you to everyone who contributed to and used this project!

## About
This repository contains the OpenAPI specification for the `Official Public Invest API` (https://public.com/api/docs).

It was provided to me upon request from `Public.com` support with permission to post it publicly on October 7, 2025. For the official terms of the API, please refer to the [Public Invest API landing page](https://public.com/api/docs).
